    "Car insurers consider age to be one of their largest liabilities. For this reason, premium rates depend on age, decreasing annually until age 75, where they increase by about 4%[^1]. Likewise, insurance premium rates increase significantly after an accident where the driver is at fault. In order to explore which of these two liabilities insurers weigh more, we’ve decided to analyze how insurance rates increase after an accident for both younger and older drivers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our project, we’ve chosen to analyze premium rates of those under 25 and over 75 without regard to individual ages within those groups. At age 25, insurance rate decreases become less frequent and severe. According to Progressive, starting at age 19, insurance rates decrease between 12-13% every year until age 25, where they decrease about 6% within the next five years (Progressive). As aforementioned, these rates continue to decrease until age 75 and up. While we have data for standard insurance rates based on age, we could only find generalized statistics for how much they increase after an accident. On average, full coverage rates increase by 42% and minimum coverage rates increase 44% (Bankrate, 2024). Because all policies inform this data, we want to determine if the increase in after-accident rates is proportional to increases based on other liabilities, specifically age. \n",
    "\n",
    "A similar project by user rjsaito on GitHub sought to predict an accurate insurance model based on the policy holder’s information, including their age. They categorize age by group and align them on a scale of 1 through 6, with 1 being the youngest drivers and 6 being the oldest. This project measured a variety of variables besides age, and they found the best predictive model for premium rates is frequency of accidents times severity of accidents. They also concluded that the two age groups with the most claims are groups 1 and 6, the youngest and oldest. The oldest group still has significantly fewer accidents than the youngest. This confirms the suspicions that inform our driving question. And because younger drivers cause more accidents, we can assume based on their model that their premiums are higher. However, we are still concerned that amongst younger and older drivers with the same frequency and severity of accidents, younger drivers’ rates increase disproportionately. With this project's findings in our minds, we will explore if after-accident rates are applied fairly amongst age demographics. \n",

    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Insurance Premium Rate (Before and After Accident): The cost of insurance premiums both before and after an accident for drivers under 25 and over 75.\n",
    "- Age Group: Categorical variable indicating whether the driver is in the Under 25 or Over 75 age group.\n",
    "- Accident History: Number of Accidents, Accident Severity, At-Fault Status.\n",
    "- State: California\n",
    "- Other Potential Variables: Car Model, Driving Experience: A measure of how long the driver has held a license, which could provide additional context within the Under 25 age group. Policy Details: Specifics about the policy terms, which could influence the rate of increase after an accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data could be stored in a table format (e.g., CSV) with each variable represented as a column.\n",

    "### Observation\n",
    "- Observation Type: Each observation would represent an individual driver’s insurance profile, accident history, and premium data.\n",
    "- Total Observations: Ideally, this dataset would include thousands of drivers across California, with roughly equal representation of both the under 25 and over 75 age groups.\n",
    "- Time Period: Data should ideally be gathered over a multi-year period (e.g., 1–2 years centered around 2022) to capture insurance rate trends before and after accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collecting Methods\n",
    "- Ensure both age groups have similar data quality, accident details, and at-fault status information to avoid biases in rate changes by age.\n",
    "- Stratify data by severity and coverage type to control for these factors when analyzing the differences in rate increases by age group.\n"
