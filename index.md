    "Car insurers consider age to be one of their largest liabilities. For this reason, premium rates depend on age, decreasing annually until age 75, where they increase by about 4%[^1](#Progressive1). Likewise, insurance premium rates increase significantly after an accident where the driver is at fault. In order to explore which of these two liabilities insurers weigh more, we’ve decided to analyze how insurance rates increase after an accident for both younger and older drivers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our project, we’ve chosen to analyze premium rates of those under 25 and over 75 without regard to individual ages within those groups. At age 25, insurance rate decreases become less frequent and severe. According to Progressive, starting at age 19, insurance rates decrease between 12-13% every year until age 25, where they decrease about 6% within the next five years (Progressive). As aforementioned, these rates continue to decrease until age 75 and up. While we have data for standard insurance rates based on age, we could only find generalized statistics for how much they increase after an accident. On average, full coverage rates increase by 42% and minimum coverage rates increase 44% (Bankrate, 2024). Because all policies inform this data, we want to determine if the increase in after-accident rates is proportional to increases based on other liabilities, specifically age. \n",
    "\n",
    "A similar project by user rjsaito on GitHub sought to predict an accurate insurance model based on the policy holder’s information, including their age. They categorize age by group and align them on a scale of 1 through 6, with 1 being the youngest drivers and 6 being the oldest. This project measured a variety of variables besides age, and they found the best predictive model for premium rates is frequency of accidents times severity of accidents. They also concluded that the two age groups with the most claims are groups 1 and 6, the youngest and oldest. The oldest group still has significantly fewer accidents than the youngest. This confirms the suspicions that inform our driving question. And because younger drivers cause more accidents, we can assume based on their model that their premiums are higher. However, we are still concerned that amongst younger and older drivers with the same frequency and severity of accidents, younger drivers’ rates increase disproportionately. With this project's findings in our minds, we will explore if after-accident rates are applied fairly amongst age demographics. \n",

We can also consider historical trends or events that may have caused biases in the data and keep it in our minds as we analyze the data. While analyzing the data, we can check for unnatural skews or distributions and use them to look into potential biases. We can also use different datasets to see if there's any issues with a particular dataset or specific fields. \n",

"There are definitely some privacy concerns with this topic, as a lot of people do not like their insurance and car accident information being collected and published publicly. There are many issues that could arise and be problematic, like the frequency people in each age group drives, the difference in the type of cars older and younger people like to drive, and the fact that younger people are more prone to reckless driving. We will handle these issues by using an anonymous data set where the names of the people are not published.\n",
"\n",
"We might not be able to fully take out the inherent age related biases in the data, but we can mitigate some of the problem by not including cases where extreme behavior or only analyzing cases where everything else about the drivers is the same except for their age.\n",
